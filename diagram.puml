note right of cli
  Developers can use CLI for
  automated component generation
  in their workflow
end note

note right of frontend
  Web interface provides visual
  feedback and live preview
  of generated components
end note

note right of aiEngine
  Multi-modal AI processes both
  visual designs and textual
  business logic together
end note
